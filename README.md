# graph-neural-net
this code is a intro to graph neural nets where we make a shallow look up node embedding just to understand the basics and a few fearures for the graph 
The code starts with first visualising the Zackery Karate club and its members 
the first 4 qns are to make fearures for the graph which could be used for deeper graph neural nets but here we dont really use it 
later using tensor we make a embedding layer which have 16 dimentions for each node 
The way we are training our embedding is against positive and negative nodes which have truth lables [1 , 0] but because we use 78*2 edges overfitting is a big issue
